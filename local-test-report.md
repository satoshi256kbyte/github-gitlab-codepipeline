## Recommendations

### For GitHub Actions:
- Install `act` for local GitHub Actions testing
- Use `.env.localstack` for environment variables
- Some GitHub-specific features (CodeQL, Dependabot) will be skipped locally

### For GitLab CI/CD:
- Install `gitlab-ci-local` for local GitLab CI/CD testing
- GitLab SAST and Dependency Scanning can run locally
- AWS CodeGuru Security will be skipped in local environment

### For CodePipeline:
- Use LocalStack for AWS service simulation
- CodeGuru Security and Inspector will be skipped locally
- Buildspec phases can be tested individually

## Next Steps

1. Fix any failed tests before deploying to real environments
2. Test with real AWS services in dev/staging environments
3. Monitor CI/CD pipeline performance differences between tools
